## Biography

Captain Robert Falcon Scott, a British naval officer, was a leading figure in early Antarctic exploration. 
                                He led two major expeditions: the Discovery Expedition (1901-1904) which conducted significant scientific research, and the ill-fated Terra Nova Expedition (1910-1913) that aimed to be the first to reach the South Pole. Though Scott and his team achieved the feat, they were tragically beaten by a Norwegian team led by Roald Amundsen.  
                                Scott and his companions perished on the return journey, forever etching their story in Antarctic exploration history.
